# small-projects

My little projects are:
  -a module 'Array.py' for python lists
  -a bouncing ball game 'bouncing ball.py' where you guide a rainbow snake to food and set a personal highscore
  -a module 'diagram.py' for creating cool diagrams
  -the dice game 'dice10000.py' that you can play with friends in python shell
